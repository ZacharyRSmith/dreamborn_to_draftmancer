I think I just created the fastest, easiest way to draft Lorcana online. If there is an easier or faster way to draft Lorcana, please let me know!

All you have to do is:
1. Export the draft list from dreamborn to clipboard,
2. paste from clipboard into the bottom of a Draftmancer Custom Card List template,
3. upload to Draftmancer as a Custom Card List, then
4. copy/paste drafted decks back into dreamborn.

Here is the template: https://github.com/ZacharyRSmith/dreamborn_to_draftmancer/blob/main/draftmancer_custom_card_list_template.txt

To import drafted deck into dreamborn.ink:
1. In Draftmancer, copy drafted deck to clipboard using 'Export > CARD NAMES'.
2. In dreamborn.ink , go to 'Deck Builder', then select 'Menu > Import', then paste clipboard into import text field, then select 'Import'.

Using lorcana-api.com data, each card is assigned an ink cost. Rarity and other data could also be assigned with a one-line change to the python script that creates the template? If someone knows how Draftmancer expects rarity data, I or someone else can make that change then run the script to enhance the template.

I tested this on all 612 cards using: https://dreamborn.ink/decks/Xk1wFdToEUoyeb1tvU6V

I successfully exported that into the template, uploaded to Draftmancer, drafted 24 cards, then imported to dreamborn.
